Go to the python note book "Thermo_Clac_Example.ipynb" and click on the "Open in CoLab" link.  
Or go here: [Thermo calc example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JMQuinlan/Thermo/blob/main/Thermo_Calc_Example.ipynb)

Within Google's CoLab you can run the code on Google's servers, no need to install python.

You can create a copy of this file and edit it to make just about any thermodynamic calulation that you could imagine.

If you'd like to though, you can download the .ipynb or download as a .py file and use with your local install of ipython or python.
